# Style guide for issue tagging

Labels are grouped by theme and color.

## Platform

If the repository covers multiple parts, this is how we designate where 
the issue lives. (i.e. iOS and Android for cross-platform tablet app).

Color: blue

*Example: rust, golang, sql, ios, node*

## Problems

Issues that make the product feel broken.

Color: red

*Example: bug, security*

## Mindless

Converting measurements, reorganizing folder structure, and other necessary (but less impactful) tasks.

Color: yellow

*Example: chore*

## Experience

Affect user’s comprehension, or overall enjoyment of the product. These can be both opportunities and “UX bugs”.

Color: orange

*Example: design, ux*

## Environment

Server environment. With good QA, you’ll identify issues on test and staging deployments.

Color: rose

*Example: staging, test, production*

## Feedback

Requires further conversation to figure out the action steps. Most feature ideas start here.

Color: purple

*Example: discussion, rfc, question*

## Improvements

Iterations on existing features or infrastructure. Generally these update speed, or improve the quality of results. Adding a new “Owner” field to an existing “Calendar” model in the API, for example.

Color: blue

*Example: enhancement, optimization*

## Additions

Brand new functionality. New pages, workflows, endpoints, etc.

Color: green

*Example: feature*

## Pending

Taking action, but need a few things to happen first. A feature that needs dependencies merged, or a bug that needs further data.

Color: yellow

*Example: in progress, watchlist*

## Inactive

No action needed or possible. The issue is either fixed, addressed better by other issues, or just out of product scope.

Color: gray

*Example: invalid, wontfix, duplicate, on hold*
